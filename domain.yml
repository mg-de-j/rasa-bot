  utter_intro:
    - text: "alright, lets travel back in time!"

  utter_ask_era:
    - text: "What historical era would you like to visit"

  utter_prehistoric_timetravel:
    - text: "You blink and suddenly stand in a lush, steaming jungle filled with the cries of unseen giants. The ground trembles as a towering sauropod lumbers past, swaying the trees like blades of grass. Then a shadow falls over you—its massive jaw opening—and you realize a hungry T-rex has noticed you!"
  
  utter_classical_timetravel:
    - text: "You arrive in the blazing sun of ancient Greece, materializing in the middle of an open-air market buzzing with philosophers and traders. Marble temples shimmer on the hilltop, their columns glowing gold in the morning light. Just as a young man in a toga begins sketching your strange clothing, a Roman legion marches in and history shifts before your eyes."
  
  utter_medieval_timetravel:
    - text: "You stumble into a muddy village surrounded by towering wooden palisades, where peasants stop and gape at your unfamiliar attire. Knights on horseback thunder past on their way to a distant castle, banners whipping in the wind. When one of them demands to know which kingdom you serve, you decide it's definitely time to leave."

  utter_renaissance_timetravel:
    - text: "You find yourself in a bustling Italian workshop filled with gears, sketches, and half-built flying machines. A man with wild eyes and ink-stained fingers—none other than Leonardo da Vinci—circles you, muttering about “future-born miracles.” Before he can rope you into testing a prototype glider, you hit the return button on your device."
  
  utter_industrial_revolution_timetravel:
    - text: "In an instant, the air thickens with smoke and steam as colossal factories rumble all around you. Workers hurry through crowded streets while iron locomotives scream past like metallic beasts. When sparks fly dangerously close to your hair, you realize the 19th century is far hotter—and far louder—than you expected."
  
  utter_20th_century_timetravel:
    - text: "You tumble out of the time stream and straight into a muddy trench as sirens wail across a war-torn battlefield. Soldiers rush past you toward a battered radio post, shouting orders you barely understand over the thunder of distant artillery. When a bomber drones overhead and the ground shakes violently, you instantly realize this is one of the most dangerous times you could've visited."

  utter_future_timetravel:
    - text: "You step onto a floating city suspended above shimmering silver clouds, where drones glide like quiet birds. People communicate through holographic lights dancing above their palms, shifting shapes faster than speech. But when the sky suddenly ripples and a colossal AI-controlled ship materializes overhead, scanning for “temporal anomalies,” you decide it's best to leave before you become part of its data."

  utter_don't_understand:
    - text: "I don't understand, lets try again."

  utter_back_again:
    - text: "Wow, that was exiting! Want to do something else?"
